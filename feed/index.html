<p>Today, perhaps, every user knows that there is special spyware. But only a few people know what spyware is, what it does, and why cybercriminals need it. We will give you a short digression into the concept of spyware.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is Spy software?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This name refers to a whole range of malicious software that can penetrate your laptop, computer, or smartphone to steal data stored on the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What information does Spyware collect?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The spyware often collects your browsing data: your browsing history, your logins and passwords, and personal data that you enter on the Internet. They can also reveal the data of your payment instruments and collect information about your habits &#8211; all these spyware transfers to its owner. Yep, you fully get it: this information will not be used in your favour.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Can I catch spyware on a mobile gadget?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Of course, there are many specially adapted spyware for mobile devices. You may not notice their presence because all spyware usually runs in the background.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How can I infect my device with spyware?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There are many options. You may accidentally click on an untrusted link or open a spam e-mail in your e-mail. And now, the spyware is already loaded. Often such software is already integrated into unlicensed copies of the software. You can easily download them along with any files from the Internet. Sometimes spyware disguises itself as harmless or even useful utilities available for free on the Internet. So there are a lot of options on how to pick it up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Be vigilant, do not download dubious files, do not open e-mails from unknown recipients, and do not follow links leading to suspicious sites. And, of course, don&#8217;t forget to use the anti-spyware tools that we offer you.</p>

<p>We use mobile devices each day and even do not notice that every activity can be threatening to our cyber security. When you lurk on the Internet, you are under attack when you open your e-mail in your smartphone’s menu, even when you download funny kitties’ videos. What to do to make your gadget safe and protected? We’ve collected some tips for active smartphone users.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity is more than just software updates, helpful apps, and preventive measures these days, so we keep your phones safe with our Quantics smartphone protection services. Yet you can do some steps on your own to make your device protected from phishing and hacking. What are they, you may ask. Let’s list them in our article.</p>



<ol><li>If your gadget doesn’t support a face scanner or fingerprint scanner, you probably have to indicate some password or graphic key to unlock it. Be sure that you cover your device’s screen from prying eyes when you do this.</li><li>Do not use public Wi-Fi networks. Try to use your mobile Internet network as it is safer than alarming everyone. Your device is connected to a public network where even a novice criminal can hack it.</li><li>Do not use charging stations from unknown persons. Cybercriminals have developed the modification of chargers to infect devices with malware via them.</li><li>Do not install apps from unknown websites. Use only PlayMarket/AppStore as a source of applications worth your attention.</li><li>Keep your data in protected cloud storage. Do not keep it on your smartphone’s SD card or any drive.</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p>And of course, do not leave your mobile device without an eye, even for a minute. Sometimes, even several seconds are enough to ruin your reputation or career by hacking your smartphone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every year, the pressure from cybercriminals on businesses is growing rapidly. As a business moves online, it becomes not only more accessible to customers and more vulnerable to cybercriminals. In particular, a 2021 CheckPoint Research report informs that the world has seen a tremendous increase in cyber attacks targeting businesses. Compared to the previous year, the growth is 40%! At the same time, another analytical agency, Accenture, notes that 55% of all companies with online offices are not sufficiently protected from cyber attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our company, you can get effective solutions for the security of your business and convenient tariff plans. But other than that, let&#8217;s take a look at 5 solutions you can implement along the way to improve your cybersecurity.</p>



<p><strong>Tip #1: Use protected cloud storage</strong></p>



<p>Cloud infrastructure is especially relevant for small businesses because it allows you to do without servers and the cost of maintaining them. Secure cloud storage will allow you to operate data without problems while setting access levels and not worrying about protection.</p>



<p><strong>Tip #2: Using e-mail protection is a must</strong></p>



<p>Do you know how much of your data can be leaked when your corporate e-mail account is hacked? What if all your company addresses are hacked? E-mail protection is not just a way to keep your data intact; it also protects your business reputation. In addition to stealing your data, criminals can use your e-mail for their own, far from righteous, purposes.</p>



<p><strong>Tip #3: Be sure that your data don’t leak due to human factor</strong></p>



<p>The human factor is often causing more harm than directed criminal activity. Imagine that your employee sends a letter with confidential new contract details to the wrong addressee. The consequences can be catastrophic both for you and your possible counterparty! To avoid this, try to implement two solutions at once. First, regularly conduct motivational training pieces with staff to increase the level of responsibility and reduce the risk of mistakes. Secondly, use DLP systems that control outgoing data based on text analysis and block prohibited user actions.</p>



<p><strong>Tip #4 Informational security training is a must</strong></p>



<p>Even if your business has little to do with transferring important data, your employees must know ​​what information security is. This is useful both for corporate purposes and for them personally. Therefore, as we mentioned above, training employees in cybersecurity principles is worth spending your resources on.</p>



<p><strong>Tip #5: Make sure your coffee maker doesn’t leak data</strong></p>



<p>Despite the comic subtitle, this is a rather severe fact. The number of attacks carried out using IoT hacking is on the rise. Therefore, if your office has smart devices that work on the Internet of Things technology, do not forget that it is necessary to protect all devices that are part of the company&#8217;s internal network and, even more so, those that have access to the Internet. So the joke about the coffee maker is not without meaning, as is the control of video surveillance systems, smart sensors, and digital systems installed in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cyber security is not a mythical concept from sci-fi books and movies about the future. This is what will help you keep your data safe from hackers.</p>

<p>There is no need to say that cybercriminals improve their skills to harm your gadgets or steal personal data. Even special trendy topics and newsbreaks work as a tasty lure for a user, and these hooks become even more sophisticated with time. What were the methods and newsbreaks that cybercriminals used successfully in 2021? Let’s talk in detail about them.</p>



<ol><li>The topic of COVID-19 was one of the most triggering ones to hook users who eagerly lurked on the Internet to get information about the pandemic. Yet, in 2021, its influence was diminished, and the topic of vaccination substituted it. One of the most effective phishing methods based on the vaccination theme was sending fake surveys via e-mail to encourage employees to click the phishing link in the letter&#8217;s body.</li><li>According to user awareness projects carried out by Positive Technologies, in 2021, fake corporate e-mails related to changes in bonuses and salaries were especially “successful” (such e-mails and files attached to them were opened by an average of 28% of employees), updates social package (54% of openings) and banking services tariffs (59% of openings).</li><li>Phishing sites devoted to movie premieres are also on the top. Users go to them hoping to see the premiere, and here they are, hooked and robbed. These sites are usually looking similar to streaming sharks like Netflix or Hulu. They did offer the subscription to their services lots of users eagerly bought, making their banking data threatened.</li><li>False bank sites are also flourishing on the world wide web. Sometimes, criminals send special offers via messengers to encourage users to click the fake link and indicate their payment data on the bank twin site. Can you guess what should happen when the user does so? Bingo! All the data about their payment methods became a robber’s prey.</li><li>Investment offers are also among the top methods of phishing. Some criminals imitate popular crypto exchange sites to attract users. They offered profitable investment opportunities and then robbed you when you click the link in the message/e-mail.</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p>Although 2021 is over, these challenges are not outdated yet. So don’t lose your vigilance and use effective cyber security protection methods from Quantics.</p>
